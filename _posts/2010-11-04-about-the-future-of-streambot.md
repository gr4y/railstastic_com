Some months ago I started my ruby carreer with the streambot gem and last sunday I decided to not continue it. With the 0.5.0 release it stopped working and actually I don't have enough time to fix or refactor it. Maybe I will continue the work on the streambot gem someday, but for now I declare it for discontinued! If you want to continue the project then just fork it on github and hack your way.
