Last week I had a nice cold, so I had no power to work on my rails application. Yesterday I had time and I played around with flash (not adobe flash) messages of the ActionController. I searched for the best solution to display these messages to the site.

After testing five or six snippets from the web I decided to write my own:
<script src="http://gist.github.com/446040.js"></script>

Finally I added some simple css and I was happy! 

Happy Easter!
