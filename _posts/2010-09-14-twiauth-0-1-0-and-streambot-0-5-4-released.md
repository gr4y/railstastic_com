<strong>twiauth 0.1.0</strong>
Last week twitter removed basic authentication and my <a href="http://www.icinga.org">monitoring</a> couldn't send me direct messages anymore, so I quickly hacked a small ruby wrapper for the twitter oauth interface and pushed it to <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/twiauth">rubygems.org</a>

In the future, I should clean it up a bit, add it as an dependency to the streambot gem and remove the authentication stuff from streambot. 

<strong>streambot 0.5.4</strong>
With version 0.5.4 the streambot gem is stable again and working properly. It was a buggy time since 0.5.0 ... ;-)
