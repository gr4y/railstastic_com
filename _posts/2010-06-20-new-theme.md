Why I changed the Theme: The old one needed more than 6 seconds to load and this was too much in my opinion. First, I wanted to switch from WordPress to Textpattern, but I changed my mind and modified the new WordPress Default-Theme. The CSS of the WordPress Default-Theme was a mess. <em>Dear, Developers of WordPress: Please learn some CSS! </em> 

The new Theme is loading in 3-4 seconds on my machine. And by the way: I removed the Facebook Like Button!
