I am thinking about the next release of the streambot gem. I want to push it to a next level. First a new filtering mechanism is in development so you can filter out tweets from special users like other bots to avoid duplicated content. Or you can filter out tweets in specified languages like german or japanese. Then the blacklisting gonna be deprecated in 0.5.0 and gonna be removed in an future release.

The second new feature I planned for 0.5.0 is an callback mechanism to make it comfortable for you to extend streambot without hacking the streambot base classes. I can't determine an release date. It's gonna be released when it is ready. ;-)
