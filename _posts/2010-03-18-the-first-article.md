Hi, i want to welcome you to railstastic. First i want to introduce myself. I am Sascha from Germany, At this point I am 20 years old and I work part time as an java developer. I don't like java very much. Plenty of time I worked with zend framework and started with a new private project. But actually I lost the motivation in coding php. It was to complicated at some points, so I stopped the development and heard about ruby in the german podcast <a href="http://chaosradio.ccc.de/chaosradio_express.html" target="_blank">Chaosradio Express</a>.

So I bought a book about ruby and started from scratch with my first twitterbot and it worked fine. First the bot retweeted all results from the twitter-search, then I added a blacklist and some weeks later I started to implement the native retweet method. A good start with ruby so far.

Several weeks ago I read about ruby on rails and I wanted to give it a try and I loved it! Actually I am waiting for rails 3 and the great new improvements to start of.Â Three weeks in the past I had the initial idea for this blog while coding java and I recently realized it. I want to write about rails and me and contribute my solutions to the rails world. I am planning to write in english and I think I can do that.
